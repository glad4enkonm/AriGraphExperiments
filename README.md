# AriGraphExperiments

**Reproducing Key Components of "AriGraph: Learning Knowledge Graph World Models with Episodic Memory for LLM Agents"**
Note : This is an independent implementation. For official code, [see](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/AriGraph).

## Overview  
This repository implements core components of the **AriGraph** framework, which enables LLM agents to build structured memory graphs combining *semantic knowledge* and *episodic experiences* for complex decision-making. The architecture is inspired by the paper's focus on text-game environments and multi-hop reasoning.
